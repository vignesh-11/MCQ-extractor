Amount of solute Concentration= Amount of solvent Solubility : It is defined as the  amount of solute dissolved in 100g of solvent to form a saturated solution. Suspension : It is a non-homogeneous mixture in which solids are dispersed in liquids. In it the solute particles do not dissolve but remains suspended through out the bulk of the medium. Colloids or colloidal solution : Colloid is a  heterogeneous mixture. The size of particles of a colloid is intermediate between true solutions and suspensions (i.e between 1nm and 100 nm). The particles of a colloid can not be seen with naked eye. Types of colloidal solution : Since colloidal solution is heterogeneous mixture it consists of two phases. These are (i) dispersed phase (colloidal particles) (ii) dispersion medium (The medium in which colloidal particles are dispersed.) Emulsion : Emulsions are liquid-liquid colloids. Types of Emulsion : Emulsions are of two types : (i)  water in oil (ii)  oil in water Emulsifiers are those substances that help in forming stable emulsions of oil and water, e.g. milk, cod-liver oil, cold creams, vanishing creams, moisturising cream, paints, etc. Physical change : During such a change no new substances is formed and there is no change in the chemical properties of the substances. Chemical change : Such a change is accompanied by change in chemical properties and formation of new substances. Elements are a type of pure substances. An element is a substance that can not be split into two or more simpler substances by usual chemical methods of applying heat, light or electric energy. Types of elements : Elements have been divided into metals and non-metals. All metals (except mercury) are solids. mercury is a liquid, e.g. sodium, potassuim, gold, silver etc. All non-metals are solids or gases (Bromine is an exception as it is a liquid non-metal) e.g. hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, bromine, chlorine, iodine etc. Compound : A compound is a substance made up of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio by weight. e.g. water (H2O) is a compound made up of two elements Hydrogen and Oxygen chemically combined in a fixed proportion of 1: 8 by weight.

It states that \u201cIn all physical and chemical changes, the total mass of reactants is equal to total mass of products.\u201d Law of constant proportions (or constant composition) : This law was first stated by Proust in 1797. According to the  law  \u201ca  chemical compound is always found to be made up of the same elements combined together in the same proportions by weight\u201d e.g. the ratio of hydrogen and oxygen in pure water is always 1 : 8 by weight. This law is also called law of definite proportions. Law of multiple proportions : This law was given by John Dalton (1803) and states that \"when two elements combine to form two or more compounds, the different mass of one of the elements and the fixed mass of the one with which it combines always form a whole number ratio\". This law explains the concept of formation of more than one compound by two elements. Dalton s Atomic theory : Postulates of Dalton s Atomic Theory (i) Matter is made up of extremely small indivisible particles called atoms. (ii) Atoms of the same substance are identical in all respects i.e., they possess same size, shape, mass, chemical properties etc. (iii) Atoms of different substances are different in all respects i.e., they possess different size, shape, mass etc. (iv) Atom is the smallest particle that takes part in a chemical reaction. (v) Atoms of different elements may combine with each other in a fixed simple, whole number ratio to form compound atoms. (vi) Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed i.e., atoms are indestructible. Atom : It is the smallest particle of an element which can take part in a chemical change. It may or may not be capable of independent existence. Symbol : The abbreviation used for lengthy names of elements are termed as their symbols. The symbol of an element is the first letter or the first and another letter of English name or Latin name of the element. While writing a symbol, the first letter is always capital and the second is always small. Molecule : It is the smallest particle of an element or compound that is capable of independent existence and shows all the properties of that substance. [The molecules of an element is made up of only one and same type of atoms, while the molecule of a compound is made up of dissimilar atoms] Atomicity : The number of atoms present in a molecule of an element or a compound is known as its atomicity. e.g. the atomicity of oxygen is 2 while atomicity ozone  is 3. Ion : It is an electrically charged atom or group of atom. It is formed by the loss or gain of electrons by an atom. Ions are of two types : (i) Cation : It is positively charged ion and is formed by the loss of electron from an atom e.g. H+, Na+, Ca2+, Al3+, NH4 + etc. (ii) Anion : It is negatively charged ion and is formed by the gain of electrons by an atom, e.g. Cl , O2 , C , F ,  2  3 CO   3  4 PO etc. Valency : The combining power (or capacity) of an element is known as its valency. Formula of simple and molecular compounds Binary compounds are those compounds which are made up of two different elements e.g. NaCl, KBr, CaO etc. Following rules are to be followed for writing the formula. (i) The valencies or charges on the ions must be balanced. (ii) For a compound made up of a metal and a non-metal the symbol of metal is written first. (iii) In compounds formed with polyatomic ions, the ion is enclosed in a bracket before writing the number to indicate the ratio. Sub-Atomic Particles (i) Electrons: Electron was discovered in cathode ray experiment. (ii) The term electron was coined by G.J. Stoney (iii) Protons were discovered in anode ray experiment. Anode rays are also called positive rays or canal rays. Protons was discovered by Wilhelm Wien in 1902. It was identified by J.J. Thomson. (iv) Neutron was discovered by James Chadwick in 1932. Structure of Atom 2 C-54 GENERAL SCIENCE Valency : The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons. These electrons determine the valency of an atom. Valency is equal to the number of valence electrons. In case the number of valence electrons is close to its full capacity. Then, Valency =8 valence electrons - If outermost shell is completely filled then valency is zero. Valency is the combining capacity of an atom. Atomic number (Z) : Atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom. Atomic number (Z) = number of protons             = number of electrons. Mass number (A) : It refers to the total number of neutrons and protons (i.e., sum of protons and neutrons) called collectively as nucleus, present in an atom. Mass number (A) = number of protons + number of neutron Isotopes : Atoms of the same element having same atomic number but different mass numbers are known as Isotopes e.g. 35 17 Cl  and 36 17 Cl , 1 1H  and 2 1 H , 12 6 C  and14 6 C  etc. Applications of Isotopes : Isotopes are used in various fields. For example. (i) Isotope of uranium is used as a fuel in nuclear reactor (ii) Isotope of cobalt is used in treatment of cancer (iii) Isotope of iodine is used in treatment of goitre. Isobars : Atoms of different elements having same mass numbers are known as Isobars, e.g K-40 and Ar-40  The discovery of cathode rays was done by J.J. Thomson an English physicist. Properties of cathode rays : \u2022 The cathode rays are constituted by fast moving electrons. \u2022 These rays travel in a straight line. \u2022 These rays posses mechanical energy. \u2022 These rays produce heat when focussed on metals. \u2022 These rays produce flourescenes when focussed on metals. \u2022 They affects the photographic plate. \u2022 They are deflected by electric and magnetic field. \u2022  They ionize the gases through which they pass. \u2022 They travel in a straight line. \u2022 They can produce mechanical effects. \u2022 Anode rays are positively charged. \u2022 The nature of anode rays depends upon the gas taken in the discharge tube. \u2022 The mass of anode rays particles is almost equal to the mass of an atom from which it is formed. Sub-atomic Particles : Electron, proton and neutron are subatomic particles. The credit for discovery of these particles goes to Electron   J.J. Thomson and Proton   E. Goldstein Another subatomic particle which is neutral and has a mass approx. equal to that of a proton was called neutron and was discovered by Chadwick. The neutron is a neutral particle found in the nucleus of an atoms. Atom of all elements contain neutron (except hydrogen atom which does not contain neutron). The relative mass of neutron is 1 amu and it carries no charge (i.e., it is neutral) Properties of atomic particles (Comparative) Particle Electron Proton Neutron (i) Symbol e or e  p n (ii) Nature Negatively charged Positively charged neutral (no charge) (iii) (a) Charge (a)   1.6 \u00d7 10 19C (a) + 1.6 \u00d7 10 19C 0 (b) Unit charge (b)  1 (b) + 1 0 (iv) Mass (a) amu (a) 0.0005486 amu (a) 1.00753 amu (a) 1.00893 amu (b) kg (b) 9.1 \u00d7 10 31kg (b) 1.67265\u00d7 10 27 kg (b) 1.67495 \u00d7 10 27 kg (v) Location Extra nuclear space nucleus nucleus (vi) Notation  1 e0 1 1p 1 0 n (vii) Relative mass 1/1840 1 1 Structure of Atom C-55 The formation of SO2 and SO3 explain",

        "question (291)": "Classification means identifying similar species and grouping them together. Lavoisier divided elements into two main types known as metals and non-metals. Doberiner s Law of triads: According to this law, \u201cin certain triads (group of three elements) the atomic mass of the central element was the arithmetic mean of the atomic masses of the other two elements.\u201d But in some triads all the three elements possessed nearly the same atomic masses, therefore the law was rejected. e.g., atomic masses of Li, Na and K are respectively 7, 23 and 39, thus the mean of atomic masses of 1st and 3rd element is = 7 + 39 = 23 Limitations of Doberiner s Triads: He could identify only a few such triads and so the law could not gain importance. In the triad of Fe, Co, Ni, all the three elements have a nearly equal atomic mass and thus does not follow the above law. Newland s Law of octaves: According to this law \u201cthe elements are arranged in such a way that the eighth element starting from a given one has properties which are a repetition of those of the first if arranged in order of increasing atomic weight like the eight note of musical scale.\u201d Drawback of Newland s law of octaves: (i) According to Newland only 56 elements exists in nature and no more elements would be discovered in the future. But later on several new element were discovered whose properties did not fit into law of octaves. (ii) In order to fit new elements into his table Newland adjust two elements in the same column, but put some unlike elements under the same column. Thus, Newland s classification was not accepted. Mendeleev s periodic table : Mendeleev arranged 63 elements known at that time in the periodic table. According to Mendeleev \u201cthe properties of the elements are a periodic function of their atomic masses.\u201d The table consists of eight vertical column called  groups  and horizontal rows called  periods . Merits of Mendeleev s periodic table: (i) At some places the order of atomic weight was changed in order to justify the chemical and physical nature. (ii) Mendeleev left some gap for new elements which were not discovered at that time. (iii) One of the strengths of Mendeleev s periodic table was that, when inert gases were discovered they could be placed in a new group without disturbing the existing order. Characteristics of the periodic table : Its main characteristics are : (i) In the periodic table, the elements are arranged in vertical rows called groups and horizontal rows called periods. (ii) There are eight groups indicated by Roman Numerals I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII. The elements belonging to first seven groups have been divided into sub-groups designated as A and B on the basis of similarities. The elements that are present on the left hand side in each group constitute sub- group A while those on the right hand side form sub-group B. Group VIII consists of nine elements arranged in three triads. (iii) There are six periods (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). In order to accomodate more elements, the periods 4, 5, 6 are divided into two halves. The first half of the elements are placed in the upper left corners and the second half occupy lower right corners in each box. Achievements of Mendeleev s periodic table (i) The arrangement of elements in groups and periods made the study of elements quite systematic in the sense that if properties of one element in a particular group are known, those of the others can be easily predicted. (ii) Prediction of new elements and their properties : Many gaps were left in this table for undiscovered elements. However, properties of these elements could be predicted in advance from their expected position. This helped in the discovery of these elements. The elements silicon, gallium and germanium were discovered in this manner. (iii) Correction of doubtful atomic masses : Mendeleev corrected the atomic masses of certain elements with the help of their expected positions and properties. Limitations of Mendeleev s classification : (i) He could not assign a correct position of hydrogen in his periodic table, as the properties of hydrogen resembles both with alkali metals as well as with halogens. (ii) The isotopes of the same element will be given different position if atomic number is taken as basis, which will disturb the symmetry of the periodic table. Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties 3 C-58 GENERAL SCIENCE (iii) The atomic masses do not increases in a regular manner in going from one elements to the next. So it was not possible to predict how many elements could be discovered between two elements. Modern periodic law : This law was given by Henry Moseley in 1913. It states, \u201cProperties of the elements are the periodic function of their atomic numbers\u201d. Cause of periodicity : Periodicity may be defined as the repetition of the similar properties of the elements placed in a group and separated by certain definite gap of atomic numbers. The cause of periodicity is the resemblance in properties of the elements is the repetition of the same valence shell electronic configuration. Modern periodic table Moseley proposed this modern periodic table and according to which \u201cthe physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic number and not the atomic weight.\u201d (i) The modern periodic table has 18 vertical columns called \u201cgroups\u201d and seven horizontal rows called \u201cperiods\u201d. The groups have been numbered 1, 2, 3.......18 from left to right. (ii) The elements belonging to a particular group make a family and usually named after the first member. In a group all the elements contain the same number of valence electrons. (iii) In a period all the elements contain the same number of shells, but as we move from left to right the number of valence shell electrons increases by one unit. The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in a shell can be calculated by the formula 2n2 where n is the number of the given shell from the nucleus. Trends in modern periodic table : The trends observed in some important properties of the elements in moving down the group (from top to bottom of the table) and across a period (from left to right in a period) are discussed below : (i) Valency : Valency may be defined as \u201cthe combining capacity of the atom of an element with atoms of other elements in order to acquire the stable configuration (i.e. 8 electron in valence shell. In some special cases it is 2 electrons).\u201d (ii) Atomic size : It refers to the distance between the centre of nucleus of an isolated atom to its outermost shell containing electrons. The atomic radius decreases on moving from left to right along a period. This is due to an increase in nuclear charge which tends to pull the electrons closer to the nucleus and reduces the size of the atom. In a group atomic size decreases from top to bottom due to increase in number of shells. (iii) Metallic and non-metallic properties : In a period from left to right metallic nature decreases while non-metallic character increases. In a group metallic character increases from top to bottom while non-metallic character decrease. (iv) Electronegativity : The relative tendency of an atom to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself is called electronegativity. In a period from left to right, the value of electronegativity increases while in a group from top to bottom the value of electronegativity decreases.

Physical properties of non-metals : (i) They are dull, however diamond, graphite and iodine are lustrous. (ii) They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. Graphite is a good conductor. (iii) They are weak and brittle (they easily break or shatter). (iv) They have a low density (they feel light for their size). (v) They do not make a ringing sound when they are hit. (vi) Melting points and boiling points are usually low. (vii) Non-metals are usually soft. (Diamond is an exception, it is quite hard. It is a crystalline solid). (viii) They exist in allotropic forms. 8. Uses of Non-Metals (i) Oxygen is essential for survival of life. (ii) Hydrogen is used to convert vegetable oil into vegetable ghee by hydrogenation. (iii) Nitrogen is used to preserve food and for manufacturing proteins by plants. (iv) Carbon in the form of diamond is used for cutting rocks and in the form of graphite as electrode and in manufacturing of lead pencils. (v) Sulphur is used in vulcanization of rubber, as fungicide and in manufacture of dyes, gun powder etc. (vi) Chlorine is used as water disinfectant and in the manufacture of pesticides like gammaxene. Extraction of Metals (i) Minerals: The natural substance in which the metals or their compounds occur in the earth is called minerals. (ii) Ores: The minerals from which the metals can be conveniently and economically extracted are called ores. (iii) Native ores: These ores contain metals in the free state, e.g., silver, gold, platinum, etc. (iv) Metallurgy: The whole process of obtaining a pure metal from one of its ore is known as metallurgy. (v) Gangue or matrix: Ores usually contain soil, sand, stones and others useless silicates. These undesired impurities present in ores are called gangue or matrix. (vi) The removal of unwanted earthy and silicious impurities from the ore is called ore-dressing or concentration of ores and the process used to concentrate an ore is called the benefication process. (vii)Concentration of ore is achieved by (a) physical methods, and (b) chemical methods (viii) Physical methods are: (a) Hand-picking: It is used in the case when the impurities are quite distinct from the ore so that these may be differentiated by naked eye. (b) Hydraulic washing or Levigation or Gravity separation: The separation is based on the difference in the specific gravities of the gangue particles and the ore particles. (c) Electromagnetic separation: When one component either the ore or impurity is magnetic in nature, this method can be used for separation. (d) Froth floatation process: This method is used for the concentration of sulphide ores. (ix) Chemical method (Leaching) involves the treatment of the ore with a suitable reagent as to make it soluble while impurities remain insoluble. The ore is recovered from the solution by suitable chemical method. (x) Extraction process used to obtain metals in free state from concentrated ores is called extraction. (xi) Extraction of crude metal from the concentrated ore involves following chemical processes. (a) Conversion of ore into metallic oxides. \u2022 Calcination involves heating the ore below its fusion temperature in the absence of air. It can remove moisture from hydrated oxide or CO2 from carbonates. It makes the ore porous. \u2022 Roasting is the heating of the ore in the presence of air below its fusion temperature. (b) Reduction to free metal: \u2022 Smelting: This involves the reduction of the ore to the molten metal at a high temperature. For the extraction of electropositive metals such as Pb, Fe, Sn, powerful reducing agent like C, H2 CO, Al, Mg, etc., are used. \u2022 Self reduction process : These processes are also called auto-reduction process. \u2022 Electrolytic process: The oxides of highly electropositive metals like Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al, etc., are extracted by electrolysis of their oxides, hydroxides or chlorides in fused state. For example,  Al is obtained by the electrolysis of alumina mixed with cryolite. (xii) Refining is the process of purifying the extracted metals. (xiii)Chromatography is based on the principle that the different components of a mixture are adsorbed to different extents on an adsorbent.

Rusting is 2 2 2 3 2 3 Fe(s) O (g) xH O( ) Fe O .xH O(s) 2 + + \u00be\u00be  l  i.e., rust is hydrated iron (III) oxide. Prevention of Corrosion : Iron and steel (alloy of iron) are most easily protected by paint which provides a barrier between the metal and air/water. Moving parts on machines can be protected by a water repellent oil or grease layer. Other important methods are (i) Alloying : Iron or steel along with other metals can also be protected by  alloying  or mixing with other metals (e.g., chromium) to make non-rusting alloys. (ii) Galvanizing : Coating iron or steel with a thin zinc layer is called  galvanizing . Purity of Gold : 24-Carat gold : The carat (abbreviation ct or Kt) is a measure of the purity of gold alloys.

Atmosphere: The gaseous envelop surrounding the earth. It has been classified into following  regions:- (i) Stratosphere : The layer of the earth s atmosphere above the troposphere and below the mesosphere. (ii) Troposphere : The lowest region of the atmosphere extending from earth s surface to the lower boundary of the stratosphere. In this region, human beings along with other organisms live. It contains water vapour and is greatly affected by air pollution. Note : The other two layers are Thermosphere and Mesosphere. Air pollution : The major air pollutants are (i) Carbon monoxide (CO) : It is produced by incomplete combustion of gasoline in motor vehicles, wood, coal, inceneration and forest fires. It is treacherous and deadly poisonous gas. It induces headache, visual difficulty coma and death. It blocks the normal transport of oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body. (ii) Sulphur dioxide ( 2 SO ) : It is produced by petrol combustion, coal combustion, petrol refining and smelting operations. It hinders the movement of air in and out of lungs. It is particularly poisonous to trees causing chlorosis and dwarfing. In presence of air it is oxidised to  3 SO  which is also irritant. 2 2 SO  +  2 O  (air) \u00be  \u00be  2 3 SO In presence of moisture  3 SO  is converted into highly corrosive sulphuric acid. 3 SO  +  O H2  (moisture ) \u00be  \u00be   4 2SO H It attacks marble, limestone,vegetation, paper and textiles and injurious to human beings. (iii) Oxides of nitrogen :  2 NO  and NO, Source - combustion of coal, gasoline, natural gas, petroleum refining, chemical plants, manufacturing explosives and fertilizers, tobacco smoke. Breathing  2 NO  causes chlorosis to plants and chronic lung conditions leading to death.  2 NO  reacts with moisture to form acids.  2NO2 +  O H2  \u00be  \u00be   2 HNO  +  3 HNO , 3 2 HNO  \u00be  \u00be  2NO +   3 HNO  +  O H2 (iv) Smoke, dust : Sources : cement works, iron and steel works, gas works, power generating stations.

Adsorbing gas and liquid molecules over activated charcoal and silica gel. Chemical reactions. Use of precipitators to settle charge particles. Use of settling chambers under the action of gravity. Use of natural gas in place of diesel, petrol, etc. Water pollution : The contamination of water by foreign substances which would constitute a health hazard and make it harmful for all purposes (domestic, industrial or agriculture etc.) is known as water pollution. The polluted water may have offensive odour, bad taste, unpleasant colour, murky oily, etc. (i) Sources of water pollution",

        "question (476)": "Definition Chemistry is a branch of science which deals with study of matter and various changes it undergoes. It deals with the preparation, properties, reactions and structures of chemical elements and compounds. For convenience the study of chemistry is sub-divided into various branches such as: (i) Inorganic chemistry (ii) Organic chemistry (iii) Physical chemistry (iv) Analytical chemistry (v) Industrial chemistry Valency During the formation of molecules of compounds, atoms combine in certain fixed proportions. This  is because of the fact that different atoms have different combining capacities. The combining capacity of an atom or radical is known as its valency. Ions or radicals In addition to atoms and molecules, a third type of particles occurs in substances. These particles, called ions, or atoms or group of atoms that carry an electrical charge. An ion is formed when electrons are removed from or added to an atoms or group of atoms. When electrons is/are removed the resulting ion is called a cation or basic radical. A cation is positively charged ion. (e.g. Na+ ). When electron is/are added the resulting ion is called an anion or acidic radicals. An anion is negatively charged ion (e.g. , 2 2 Cl ,O ) - - An ion or radical is classified as monovalent, divalent, trivalent  or tetravalent  when the number of charges over it is 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively. Formula of Elements and Compounds Formula of elements: The molecule of an element is denoted by writing the symbol of the element and, to the right and below it, a number expressing the number of atoms in the molecule. Formula of compound : A molecule of a compound may be made up of atom of different elements linked up together chemically and in definite proportion by weight. Chemical formula : It is of two types : (i) Molecular formulae : Chemical formulae that indicate the actual number and type of atoms in a molecule is called molecular formulae. (ii) Empirical formulae : Chemical formulae that indicate only the relative number of atoms of each type in a molecule is called empirical formulae. Equivalent weight (i) Equivalent weight of element = Atomic weight of element Valency of element (ii) Eq. wt of an acid/base =  Molecularmass Basicityof acid /Acidityof base (iii) Eq. wt of salts =  Formula mass (Valencyof cation)(No.of cations) Expression of strength /concentration of Solution (i) Mass percent = Weight of solute (gm) 100 Weight of solution (gm) \u00b4 (ii) Normality  =   Number of gram equivalents of solute Volume of solution (lit.) (iii) Molarity = Number of gram moles of solute volume of solution (lit.) (iv) Molality  = Gram moles of solute Weight of solvent (kg) (v) Mole fraction : Mole fraction of solute                 = XA =  + A A B n n n Mole fraction of solvent = XB =  + B A B n n n XA + XB = 1 General Concepts of Chemistry 7 C-80 GENERAL SCIENCE Chemical reaction : The process in which a substance undergoes change to produce new substances with new properties are known as chemical reaction. For example magnesium carbonate when heated produces magnesium oxide and carbon dioxide (i.e. new substances with new properties). A chemical change is generally accompanied by a change of state, change of colour, evolution of a gas or change of temperature etc. Chemical equation : The qualitative representation of a chemical reaction in a short hand or concise form in term of symbols and formulae, is called a chemical equation. Skeletal chemical equation or symbol equation : A chemical equation written in the form of symbols and formulae is called a skeletal chemical equation. Balanced chemical equation : A chemical equation in which number of atoms of each elements on L.H.S. (i.e. reactants) and R.H.S. (i.e.products) is equal is called a balanced chemical equation. Balancing of chemical equations : The process of making the number of different elements on both side of the equation equal is known as balancing of chemical equation. Types of chemical reactions Various types of chemical reactions are :- (i) Combination reactions : Combination reactions are those in which one element reacts  with another to form a compound. This type of reactions are also known as synthesis reaction. For example, hydrogen combines with oxygen to give water. 2 2 2 2H ( ) O ( ) 2H O( ) + \u00be\u00be  l g g (ii) Decomposition reactions : Decomposition reactions are those reactions in which a compound breaks down into simpler compounds (or substances). This type of reaction is simply the reverse of combination reactions. These reactions require energy in the form of heat, light, electricity, etc. (iii) Simple displacement reaction and simple substitutions : A displacement reaction is a reaction in which an atom, or group of atoms, present in a molecule is displaced by another atom. This type of reaction can be represented as follows: AB C AC B (Compound) (Newcompound) + \u00be\u00be  + (iv) Double displacement reactions or Double decomposition : The reactions in which mutual exchange of radicals takes place are known as double decomposition reactions. As a result of double decomposition reactions two new substances are formed. Examples : 2 4 2 4 2NaCl H SO Na SO 2HCl + \u00be\u00be  + Double-displacement reactions can be further classified as precipitation, gas formation, and acid-base neutralization reactions. Precipitation reactions : A precipitation reaction occurs when two solutions are mixed together and a solid separates from the solution. The solid part that forms and separates form the solutions is called the precipitate the reaction given above is a precipitation reaction. (v) Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Oxidation : Oxidation is defined as a process which involve addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen. Reduction : The term reduction is defined as a process which involve the removal of oxygen or addition of hydrogen. (vi) Redox reactions : Those reactions in which oxidation and reduction takes place simultaneously, are known as redox reactions. Example : Reduction (removal of hydrogen) heat addition of oxygen (oxidation) CuO + H2 Cu + H2O (vii) Exothermic and endothermic reaction : Chemical reactions usually proceed with either liberation of heat or the absorption of heat. When a chemical reaction liberates heat to the surroundings, it is said to be 'exothermic reaction' and when it absorbs the heat from the surroundings, it is said to be endothermic reaction. 2 2 3 N ( ) 3H ( ) 2NH ( ) + \u00be\u00be  g g g + energy (Exothermic) 3 2 CaCO ( ) CaO( ) + CO ( )(Endothermic) D \u00be\u00be  s s g Corrosion (erosion by chemical action) : Corrosion is the degradation of metals and generally called rust. Corrosion causes  damage to car bodies, iron railings, ships and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of iron is a serious problem. Rancidity : The most important cause of deterioration in fats and fatty foods is oxidation of fats. What we perceive is an unpleasant change in the flavour and odour of a food, called rancidity.

        "question (501)": "Soaps and detergents Soap : Fatty acid salts of sodium and potassium are known  as  soaps.  These  are  prepared  by  the  action  of fatty acids with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Fatty acid + sodium hydroxide   Soap + glycerol. Detergents are sodium salt of long chain sulphonic acids or alkyl hydrogen sulphate. Advantages of detergents over soaps (i) Detergents can be used for laundering even with hard water as they are soluble even in hard water. (ii) Detergents possess better cleansing properties than soaps. Disadvantages of detergents over soap : Detergents are prepared from hydrocarbons, while soaps are prepared from edible fatty oils. Thus they are non biodegradable. Saponification : It is the process of making of soap by the hydrolysis of fats and oils with alkalis. Both soaps and detergents are soluble in water and act as surfactants  which reduce the surface tension of water to a great extent. This increases the water - fabric interaction as a consequence of which dirt particles, grease spots etc are washed away effectively. In other words soaps and detergents enhance the cleansing action of water. Portland cement : It was first discovered in England. It is essentially a mixture of lime stone and clay. It was called Portland cement because in presence of water it sets to a hard stone-like mass resembling with the famous Portland rock. The approximate composition of Portland cement is Calcium oxide (CaO) 62% Silica (SiO2) 22% Alumina (Al2O3) 7.5% Magnesia (MgO) 2.5% Ferric oxide (Fe2O3) 2.5% The above compounds are provided by the two raw materials, namely lime stone (which provides CaO) and clay (which provides SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3). In cement, almost entire amount of lime in present in the combined state as calcium silicate (2CaO. SiO2 and 3CaO. SiO2) and calcium aluminates (3CaO. Al2O3 and 4 CaO. Al2O3). (i) Cement containing excess amount of lime cracks during setting; while cement containing less amount of lime is weak in strength. (ii) Cement with excess of silica is slow-setting and that having an excess of alumina is quick-setting. (iii) Cement containing no iron is white but hard to burn. Cement is manufactured by two processes, viz. wet and dry. A small amount (2 3%) of gypsum is added to slow down the setting of the cement so that it gets sufficiently hardened. Setting of cement is an exothermic process and involves hydration of calcium aluminates and calcium silicates. Lime stone and clay are powdered  and mixed  Burnt at 1770-1870K  in a rotatory kiln Calcium silicates +  calcium aluminates Portland Cement Addition of  gypsum C-86 GENERAL SCIENCE Important Biomolecules Vitamins Vitamin generic  descriptor name Solublility Deficiency disease Overdose disease Vitamin A Fat Nightblindness and  Keratomalacia Hypervitaminosis Vitamin B1 Water Beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff  syndrome  Drowsiness of music  relaxation with large doses Vitamin B2 Water Ariboflavinosis Vitamin B3 Water Pellagra Liver damage (doses >  2g/day) and other problems Vitamin B5  Water Paresthesia Diarrohea; possibly nausea  and heartburn Vitamin B6 Water Anemia peripheral neuropathy  nerve damage (dose > 100  mg/day) Impairment of proprioception Vitamin B7 Water Dematitis, enteritis Vitamin B9 Water Deficiency during pregnancy is  deficiency, other effects  May mask symptoms of  vitamine12 associated with  birth defects, such  as neural  tube defects Vitamin B12 Water Megaloblastic anemia No known toxicity Vitamin C Water Scurvy Vitamin C megadosage Vitamin D Fat Rickets and Osteomalancia  Hypervitamin osis D Vitamin E Fat Deficiency is very rare; mild  hemolytic anemia in newborn  Increased congestive heart  failure seen in one large  Vitamin K Fat Bleeding diathesis Increases coagulation in  patients taking warfarin.

Metabolism of Nitrogen : Fixation of N2 \u2022 Ammonia is rapidly converted first to nitrites (by Nitrobacter) by the process nitrification. 2NH3 + 3O2   2NO2   +  2H+ + 2H2O 2NO2   + O2    2NO3   \u2022 Nitrate is then either available to the plant, or converted to nitrogen gas in the process of denitrification (by Pseudomonas). \u2022 Fixation is done by both free living e.g. Azotobacters, Clostridium, Cyanobacteria like Nostoc, Anabaena and symbiotic bacteria Rhizobium. \u2022 Nodules act as the site for  2 N fixation. It contains leghaemoglobin (a pink pigment) and enzyme nitrogenase (Mo-Fe protein). \u2022 During this process, the  2 N atmospheric(dinitrogen) is reduced by the addition of hydrogen atoms to ammonia. N2 + 8e  +  8H+ + 16 ATP    2NH3 + H2 + 16ADP + 16Pi Photosynthesis \u2022 It is actually oxidation reduction process in which water is oxidised and CO2 is reduced to carbohydrates. \u2022 The reduction of CO2 to carbohydrates needs assimilatory powers, i.e., ATP and NADPH2. \u2022 Photosynthesis occurs particularly in specialised cells called mesophyll cell. These cells contain chloroplast, which is the actual sites for photosynthesis. \u2022 The two forms of chlorophyll  a  are chl a 683 (P680) and chl a 703 (P700) with peak absorption at 683 and 703 respectively are anchored in thylakoids membranes. They are the reaction centres. Electron Transport : It was first formulated by Hill (1939). It is a series of electron carrier over which electrons pass in a downhill journey releasing energy at every step that is used in generating an electrochemical proton gradient which helps in synthesising ATP. Photorespiration : Light stimulated oxidation of photosynthetic intermediates to CO2 is known as photorespiration. The course of photorespiration is related to chloroplasts, peroxisomes and mitochondria. This is a wasteful process & occurs in C3 plants. Respiration : The phenomenon of breaking of the  C C  bond of complex organic molecules through oxidation and releasing of energy for cellular use, is called respiration. C6H12O6 + 6O2    6CO2 +  6 H2O + energy ( 2870 kg) Glycolysis : The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof and  J. Parnas, hence it is referred to as the EMP pathway. It occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. C-108 GENERAL SCIENCE \u2022 Permanent  cell  division  occurs  only  in  presence  of cytokinins. It also plays important role in causing expansion of cells. \u2022 Cytokinins not only breaks dormancy but also promotes the germination of seeds. Abscisic Acid \u2022 Carns and Addicott (1963) isolated two substances Abscisin I and Abscisin II from the cotton balls, that were responsible for accelerated abscission of leaves. \u2022 ABA inhibits seed germination and growth of excised embryos. \u2022 ABA stimulates stomatal closure by inhibiting the K+ uptake by guard cell. \u2022 ABA increases tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses. Ethylene \u2022 Ethylene is only gaseous hormone (CH2 = CH2) that is synthesized in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. \u2022 Ethylene inhibits elongation of stem, causes swelling of nodes and nullifies geotropism. \u2022 It is highly effective in inducing fruit ripening when it is produced in large amount which coincides with respiratory climactric i.e., a brief rise to a very high level of respiration. This rise indicates the beginning of senescence and death. Photoperiodism \u2022 The term photoperiodism is used by Garner and Allard, 1920 for the ability of plant to detect and respond the relative length of day and night to which the plant is exposed. The site of perception of light/dark duration are leaves. \u2022 Most of the plants are short day plants that include Cosmos, Dahlia, Chrysanthemum, rice, etc. The long day plants are wheat, barley, sugar beat, larkspur, etc. Cucumber, sunflower, tobacco, tomato etc. are some examples of intermediate day plants. Vernalisation \u2022 In some plants early flowering is induced by pretreatment of seeds with a certain low temperature. Seed Dormancy \u2022 Dormancy may be defined as the inactive state of the seed in which the growth of the embryo is temporarily suspended for a specific length of time. Flower \u2022 Flowers are highly modified shoots, bearing nodes and modified floral leaves, which are meant essentially for sexual reproduction in plant. \u2022 A typical mature embryo sac of angiosperm is 7-celled, 8 nucleate structure i.e., 3 antipodal cells, 3-egg apparatus cells (consists of 2 synergids and 1 egg cell) and one central cell (2 polar nuclei). Double  Fertilization \u2022 Fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilization. \u2022 One of these male gametes fuses with egg to form diploid zygote (2n) while the other fuses with two polar nuclei of the central cell to produce triploid primary endosperm nucleus (PEN) (3n). Since, the latter involves fusion of three haploid nucleus, therefore it is called triple fusion. \u2022 In some angiosperms, two types of fusion occur in the same embryo sac \u201csyngamy\u201d leading to the formation of zygote & \u201ctriple fusion\u201d forming primary endosperm cell, this phenomenon is called \u201cdouble-fertilization\u201d. \u2022 Endosperm is the nutritive tissue which provides nourishment to the embryo in seed plant. \u2022 Seed is a fertilized ovule. After fertilization ovary begins to grow and gradually matures into fruit. \u2022 Polyembryony - Given by Leeuwenhoek (1917) in Orange More than one embryo in a seed.

(2) Secondary succession : If succession starts on the area previously colonized, but has been cleared off by some environmental force (fire, flood, lightening), it is called secondary succession. Eg. - forest devastated by fire. (3) Hydrarch : Succession which begins in water bodies like ponds.
